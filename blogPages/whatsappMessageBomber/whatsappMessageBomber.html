				It's one of the first projects I created using Python, I learnt about Selenium and
				wanted to try that out.
			</p>
			<p>
				Selenium is tool to automate web browsers. You can read more about it
				<a href="https://www.selenium.dev/about/" target="_blank"><em>here.</em></a> I am
				using Selenium with Python, it lets us use Selenium via Python Programmin Language.

				So, its a meassage bomber, it bombs someone with thousands and thousands of messages
				to someone on Whatsapp, a app almost everyone use and the good part is you don't
				actually need to have his/her contact saved in your phone's contact list. In the
				source code I have a variable called <strong>msg</strong> where the user can store
				the message which is to bombed, I just did a "Yo!" but it can be anything and can be
				of anynumber of lines/words.
			</p>
			<pre>
          <code>
msg = '''Yo!'''
          </code>
      </pre>
			<p>
				To make this program more dynamic we can use a input function and ask user for a
				message everytime user runs the program. Then, the program asks for a contact
				number. After that we need a webdriver which can be downloaded from Selenium's
				Website, it lets Selenium access your browser, I am using Google Chrome so I have
				downloaded webdriver for Google Chrome and then asked Selenium to get the whatsapp
				web website
				<a href="https://web.whatsapp.com" target="_blank">(web.whatsapp.com)</a> and pause
				the Python script for 10 seconds so that he can login to Whatsapp Web portal
				scanning the QR code
			</p>
			<pre>
        <code>
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://web.whatsapp.com/")
time.sleep(10) #Wait period for you to log-in
        </code>
      </pre>
			<p>
				Now there is a trick by you can directly message anyone on whatsapp just by a link,
				formed by a contact number and a message. so, in my Python script I asked Selenium
				to get that link or open that link in the browser window, you can se that in the
				code given below
			</p>
			<pre>
        <code>
serviceurl = "https://wa.me/"
params = dict()
params['text'] = msg
url = serviceurl + '91' + contact_number + '/?' + urllib.parse.urlencode(params)
driver.get(url)
        </code>
      </pre>
			<p>
				After this we just need to click on some buttons which can be done by Selenium with
				Python <em>click()</em> function which is called on a web element which can be found
				by its XPath using the <em>find_element_by_xpath</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				After this process, we have a chat windows in front of us of the contact we want to
				do the prank on. So now I use a loop to get the input text field (where we write our
				message) by its XPath, had the Selnium to type the message and then press the SEND
				button.
			</p>
			<pre>
        <code>
for i in range(0, 1000): #you can increase or decrease the number by changing 1000
    WebElement = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//*[@id='main']/footer/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[2]")
    WebElement.send_keys(msg)
    WebElement.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
        </code>
      </pre>
			<p>
				So now, the loop will repeat itself for 1000 times which can be increased or
				decreased by changing the second parameter in range() function.
